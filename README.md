### Annoucement

For release Friday 4th August 2017

##### All DjangoCon AU Shirts Available

To celebrate the [5th DjangoCon Australia](https://djangocon.com.au) in 2017,
we're delighted to announce that we've taken our shirt promotion a little bit
further [than
usual](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/jul/06/djangocon-australia-t-shirts-available/). 

Traditionally, DjangoCon AU is held as a specialist track of PyCon AU, the
national Python conference in Australia. As such, DjangoCon AU doesn't have the
budget to provide t-shirts for each attendee. For the past 4 years, shirts have
been made available to attendees by way of a short campaign through TeeSpring. 

For the 5th anniversary, as well as the traditional new design for the year, we
are also [reopening all the previous campaigns](http://shirts.djangocon.com.au)
for three weeks only!

Until August 25 2017, you can purchase t-shirts and hoodies from any DjangoCon
AU

Profits from every sale (~$7 per shirt, ~$5 per hoodie) will go directly to the
[Django Software Foundation](https://djangoproject.com/foundation), to help
fund activities like development sprints, travel grants to DjangoCon, and
supporting events like [Django Girls](http://djangogirls.org/) workshops.

The shirt designs can be seen on
[shirts.djangocon.com.au](http://shirts.djangocon.com.au), with links to all
the campaigns.
